- optimizations of elm build - app is getting a bit big - webpack is warning me now!
- can I make it so that tasks are not sent to the view before the initial load of all markdown?

STEP 2
------
- W: detect if tasks have been changed so I can broadcast a taskItem changed event
     instead of a delete and add.

STEP 3
------
- V: maintains (via W) file(s) to hold the order of cards
     W needs to maintain the files as it needs keeping up to date
     irrespcetive of whether the view is active
     V needs to read the file at startup so it puts cards in the right places
     if user DnDs then V sends postion changes to W which writes them to the file
     hmmmmmmm


- compare somne different forms of taskItem serialisation
    - basic TsEncode/Decode
    - can I make the taskItem encoding a bit more compact -> specially encoding Union types!
    - original strings and parse to decode
- can I remove TaskList.removeForFile, TaskList.replaceForFile, TaskList.replaceForFile
  Session.replaceTaskItems
- ensure InteropPorts uses the tested code in InteropDefinitions (as per the worker versions)
- TaskItemFields -> make alphabetical (contents is at the end atm)
- perhaps when I am removing taskItems from the view I could request a reload of all if
  the taskItem I am deleting doesn't exist
- howabout when adding taskItems communicating the expected total and if this doesn't match
  what the view has it can request a reload.
- do I need the same states in the view now that I am not loading markdown?
- speed up TaskList.replaceTaskItems as it maps through all the tasks for each replacement
  - can I short circuit when I know I have found the one.  Or should I do a remove followed
  by an add?
- typescipt tidying -> am I using async only where I need to?

- can I make it so I load any settings at startup but save the latest version
  when I get them back from elm?
- do I want to deal with Settings (as in ensure they are the latest version) in the worker?
- bug: if a file is deleted and it includes something which is shown in the completed
  column then a blank item is added at the end as I do not render the markdown for
  the newly added card.
- I get an error in the js console if I click on the command icon when the
  cardboard view is visible

---
- touch events - iPad ??
- show errors on settings pane ??

# Cleanups
- simplify parsing as per typing tutor
- replace regex stuff in TaskItem.toToggledSting with some form of token parsing
- if something is on a board because of a subtask tag and that line also has a due date on it, should I use
  that as the due date of the card?
- dataview - what if there is a due date in the frontmatter?
- check coverage and add tests
- why is the case of the filename for MultiSelect.elm not being recognised properly?
- add ts declarations to replace @ts-ignores:
    https://github.com/kometenstaub/linked-data-helper/blob/3bbee6aa49bcabd2dab0b8f86bccd2de81ed92e6/src/interfaces.ts#L26
- translator pattern for child -> parent comms ??
  https://medium.com/@alex.lew/the-translator-pattern-a-model-for-child-to-parent-communication-in-elm-f4bfaa1d3f98
- I end up with multiple copies of the app running
  - add a debug to print a string each time update is called
  - in dev mode, open cardboard
  - then close the view
  - then click the ribbon icon
  - you'll see the debug messaged double up
  - and tripple up if you do it again
  - ...

# Mobile
- you can toggle mobile emulation by entering the following in Developer Tools > Console.
  this.app.emulateMobile(!this.app.isMobile);
- use https://github.com/shabegom/obsidian-mobile-logging to console.log to a note
  inside the vault. Think this does the same as:

# UI Improvements
- nested subtasks are un-nested on cards
  - if I was going to sort this, would I want to support nested autocomplete?
- should I support reverse subtags, i.e. /todo would match #todo or #project1/todo or #a/b/todo
- should I support both ends subtags, i.e. /todo/ would match #todo or #project1/todo or #todo/foo or #a/todo/b
- What should I show on the view when there are no boards defined
- Some sort of toggle compact view - where it shows each task as a single line card
  with only the checkbox and the first line of the title.
- do I want to warn the user that I couldn't read settings at startup?
  are there any sensible options I can give them if I do?
  - gets stuck on "Loading tasks..." if flags parsing fails
  - I could use State if I added a State.Failed
- when jumping to the todo using the edit link perhaps I could highlight the complete
  taskItem block (if is has indented content).  Will have to explore the setEphemeralState
  code to see if I can do this using line numbers or whether I need to track characters..
- mobile support?
  - what is it like performance-wise?
  - prob need to use CSS grid more than I am (specially on the settings modal)
- do I want to keep the tabbar in view when horizontal scrolling? (prob yes)
- "spinner" whilst loading tasks (perhaps like in the sidebar when doing searches)
- does openLinkText use setSelection to highlight the selected todo?
  if so, I can do better as by default obsidian doesn't include all
  indented stuff under a todo item as being in the block
- confirm dialog before task deletion
- keyboard navigation
- search for card by title/content
- resizing columns
- what to do about due dates for subtasks
- undo buffer
  - for toggling completion
  - for deletion
- could/should I use some taskpaper tags:
    @defer(date) - defer until date, e.g. 2016-04-19 5pm or next Thursday -3d
    @estimate(time span) - time estimate, e.g. 2h for 2 hours or 3w for 3 weeks.
    @flagged - present when an item is flagged
    @parallel(bool) - whether children are parallel (true) or sequential (false)
    @repeat-method(method) - the repeat method: fixed, start-after-completion, or due-after-completion
    @repeat-rule(rule) - an ICS repeat rule (see RFC244557), e.g. FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1

- edit in place via popup

# Board Improvements
- do I want to sort undated (or other in tagged board) column by the mod date of the containg file?
- do I want a way of flagging cards?
- could make column ordering more efficient (e.g. TagBoard completed tasks)
- context menu to set due date to today
- filter cards on board (e.g. by tag)
- sort order for columns?

# Card Improvements
- specify format for people cards
  - if on line and they contain an image then put the pic on the card
  - support multiple people
- might be cleaner when generating markdown for display on a card to remove the wrapping <p> tag
  intesad of trying to style it's effect away using css
- right click on interal link
- right click on external link
- when clicking the edit button place the cursor at the line of the todo
  have tried to do this using setCursor and not go it to work so far
- display on card - done date

# Theme Compatibility
- Firefly Theme: why is the text so big?
- get working with tabbed view plugin
- bubble space - tags not rendering properly

# Board Types
- have a subtag board that uses a root tag then subtags to define columns
  2 optionss - all leaves or next level (to hadle nested tags)
- reverse subtag: #class1/week1, #class2/week1 (you could specify week1 to get both class 1 & 2 on a board)
- eisenhower matrix view
- #3 define a board from the contents of a file with columns set by the headings on a page
- Dataview query result board (and/or filter)
  - https://github.com/702573N/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar uses DQL
  - does kanban?

# Drag n Drop
- on a tagboard when drag-dropping allow alt-drag to duplicate the card
  - so maintaining the tag in the column being dragged from as well as getting the new
- multiselect - for drag/drop and context menu operations
- drag and drop
  - into today, tomorrow, and done columns
  - within column to change ordering
- would need a date picker for dragging into (e.g.) future

  For a date picker.

# Misc
- should probably think about not using Regex in TaskItem
- would it be cleaner to have separate multiselects for each board and share
  the dropdown items?
- I could de-bounce the rewrites of filters in the settings file on rename of path or file
- look at obsidian://show-plugin?id=card-boardw
- do I want to do anything with Alternate Checkboxes?
- supercharged links? - what does it do - does it work with cardBoard?
- https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/overview
- how small can I make the compliled js?
  https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/what-i-ve-learned-about-minifying-elm-code/7632
  look at esbuild
- put the target in dist
  - put the static sources in an assets dir and copy them into dist on build too- BadInputFromTypeScript -> I don't do anything if I can something bad from
- work out how I will handle changes to the settings file format
- Could I write a worker that keeps an eye on what is being edited and adds
  a completion timestamp when it is done?
- Settings to:
  - allow/deny directories/files
  - set max title lines
- I see that elm-ts-json now has a pipleline decoder - should switch to this as
  it makes decoders easier to read
- in the update for SettingsUpdated I am re-writing all markdown content and updating
  the hover for all edit buttons.  Can I be smarter?  Only matters really if performance
  issues.
- can I use github runners to build?
  - https://github.com/elm-tooling/elm-tooling-cli/blob/main/.github/workflows/example.yml
  - https://elm-tooling.github.io/elm-tooling-cli/ci/
  - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge
- where to use fuzz testing
- review awful typescript code!
- return something to elm if I fail to re-write a TODO due to the line having changed so I can
  let the user know why nothing has happened
- better parsing errors? - https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/newline-and-indentation-issues-in-elm-parser/4869
- look into issue fixed in commit bca367 : TODO - why does this work....
  - can I get parser to always work when there is no "\n" on the end of the input
- if it is slow parsing vaults then see if I can speed it up by
  dropping backtrackable in the TaskItems parser.

api option for preview view so when given a block reference is still shows the whole document
but scrolls the block into view and highlights it.  When this is done I can use this when
hovering over the edit button to show the details of the todo in the original doc.  At the moment
if you do this, it will only show the single line of the todo and not any subtasks or content.
